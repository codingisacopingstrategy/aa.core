<p>Baehr explains that working with scores started in fact already before <em>Un après-midi</em> with <em>Holding Hands</em>. She sketches the context of working collaborations with William Wheeler, the system of alternating roles of leading and the need to devise collaboration differently through working with scores. </p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:02:30" data-section="3" data-start="00:01:32" id="data-start000132aastart000132_rarrdata-end000230_aaend000230_data-section3" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:01:32" property="aa:start">00:01:32</span> &rarr; <span content="00:02:30" property="aa:end">00:02:30</span> </h2>
<p>Holding Hands was part of a trilogy together with <em>Un après-midi</em> and <em>The Misses and Me</em>. Baehr surveys the general theme of the trilogy: a research on emotion and the effect on the audience. </p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:04:03" data-section="4" data-start="00:02:30" id="data-start000230aastart000230_rarrdata-end000403_aaend000403_data-section4" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:02:30" property="aa:start">00:02:30</span> &rarr; <span content="00:04:03" property="aa:end">00:04:03</span> </h2>
<p>Description of the score of <em>Holding Hands</em>, based on an aria of Maria Callas in concert at Convent Garden. The entire aria is used, from ouverture to the applause by the audience. The score shows in four sections four reworkings of this aria, isolating every time different parameters.</p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:05:00" data-section="5" data-start="00:04:03" id="data-start000403aastart000403_rarrdata-end000500_aaend000500_data-section5" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:04:03" property="aa:start">00:04:03</span> &rarr; <span content="00:05:00" property="aa:end">00:05:00</span> </h2>
<p>Where you also interpreting the emotions? Baehr did not aspire mere representation or mimickry, but an analytical dissection of head movement, posture, emotion, etc, before mixing them in the full-on playback. <br />
</p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:06:08" data-section="6" data-start="00:05:00" id="data-start000500aastart000500_rarrdata-end000608_aaend000608_data-section6" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:05:00" property="aa:start">00:05:00</span> &rarr; <span content="00:06:08" property="aa:end">00:06:08</span> </h2>
<p>“The thing was to do it to see what it produces in an audience. We also realized that it needed a very naturalistic representation of emotions. It had to be very small, actually.”</p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:07:14" data-section="7" data-start="00:06:08" id="data-start000608aastart000608_rarrdata-end000714_aaend000714_data-section7" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:06:08" property="aa:start">00:06:08</span> &rarr; <span content="00:07:14" property="aa:end">00:07:14</span> </h2>
<p><em>Holding Hands</em> still tours. It’s one of the pieces that tours most. It was also performed in a version by other performers, like Sophia New and Petra Sabish. </p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:08:09" data-section="8" data-start="00:07:14" id="data-start000714aastart000714_rarrdata-end000809_aaend000809_data-section8" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:07:14" property="aa:start">00:07:14</span> &rarr; <span content="00:08:09" property="aa:end">00:08:09</span> </h2>
<p>Baehr mentions some upcoming showing dates and asks Ludovic not to tell the ending to his friends who may come to see the show. The piece works better when one does not know the ending. </p>

<p>Baehr sums up three major reasons why she uses scores: avoiding classical dramaturgy based on narrativity that is not indebted to collage aesthetics in dance theater; a practice of writing; and collaboration. </p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:11:31" data-section="10" data-start="00:09:21" id="data-start000921aastart000921_rarrdata-end001131_aaend001131_data-section10" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:09:21" property="aa:start">00:09:21</span> &rarr; <span content="00:11:31" property="aa:end">00:11:31</span> </h2>
<p>“After Holding Hands William liked to do something where he was more involved other then doing what he was told to do. (...) We found a structure where we could each write a score, and work with people from outside.” They agreed on 5 ingredients to be used for the scores that William Wheeler and Antonia Baehr made, and that was further to be used by another score-maker. In the final stage the score ends up in a set of instructions on mini-disk-players for the four performers. </p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:14:41" data-section="11" data-start="00:11:31" id="data-start001131aastart001131_rarrdata-end001441_aaend001441_data-section11" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:11:31" property="aa:start">00:11:31</span> &rarr; <span content="00:14:41" property="aa:end">00:14:41</span> </h2>
<p>Baehr speaks some of the two scores. The score of Wheeler came in the form of a book, but was never developed all the way into performance, because of lack of time. </p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:16:13" data-section="12" data-start="00:14:41" id="data-start001441aastart001441_rarrdata-end001613_aaend001613_data-section12" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:14:41" property="aa:start">00:14:41</span> &rarr; <span content="00:16:13" property="aa:end">00:16:13</span> </h2>
<p>The ingredients proposed for the score of Baehr (it’s a score for somebody to make a score) are amongst others: Jamie Lidell’s version of L’après-midi d’un faun ‘Taught to box’, on the cd ‘Replay Debussy’ after the concept of Christian von Borries.</p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:18:46" data-section="13" data-start="00:16:13" id="data-start001613aastart001613_rarrdata-end001846_aaend001846_data-section13" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:16:13" property="aa:start">00:16:13</span> &rarr; <span content="00:18:46" property="aa:end">00:18:46</span> </h2>
<p>The second ingredient is a score from Songbook ( Solo vfor Voice 3) by John Cage, which is a map-score for voice. Baehr explains the principles of this score. The third ingredient is to use a photo roman (LISSY Nr. 8/01, Fotogeschichte Auf den Hund gekommen, BRAVO Nr. 8/02 Foto-Love Story Extra ).The score of Baehr instructed someone to take a photograph and draw a path on it, or several pathlines/timelines. One is for emotion, one for positions, and a third for the speaker (who reads for the minidisk: William or Antonia), etc. </p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:19:12" data-section="14" data-start="00:18:46" id="data-start001846aastart001846_rarrdata-end001912_aaend001912_data-section14" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:18:46" property="aa:start">00:18:46</span> &rarr; <span content="00:19:12" property="aa:end">00:19:12</span> </h2>
<p>In the first version Baehr did not change anything. It did not matter if something was thrilling or not. </p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:24:22" data-section="15" data-start="00:19:12" id="data-start001912aastart001912_rarrdata-end002422_aaend002422_data-section15" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:19:12" property="aa:start">00:19:12</span> &rarr; <span content="00:24:22" property="aa:end">00:24:22</span> </h2>
<p>Baehr shows the photo that she selected to draw the map on. Se reads from her instructions. She mentions paths that are for emotions and micro-movement. There are instructions for intensity and dynamic. All was done very accurately. Baehr reads also from an analysis of the vegetation (Eucalyptus) In addition, emotion cards were used. </p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:27:21" data-section="16" data-start="00:24:22" id="data-start002422aastart002422_rarrdata-end002721_aaend002721_data-section16" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:24:22" property="aa:start">00:24:22</span> &rarr; <span content="00:27:21" property="aa:end">00:27:21</span> </h2>
<p>Van Imschoot reads one of the emotion cards, portraying ‘tenderness’. It’s one of the examples of how alba-emoting constructs emotion. One can learn about this acting technique through an article in the acting book <em>Acting (Re)considered. A Theoretical and Practical Guide (Worlds of Performance)</em>.
Alba-emoting is a countermethod to method acting or Stanislavski-based approaches, working with emotional memory. Baehr started to use this method when working on <em>Holding Hands</em>. </p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:30:00" data-section="17" data-start="00:27:21" id="data-start002721aastart002721_rarrdata-end003000_aaend003000_data-section17" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:27:21" property="aa:start">00:27:21</span> &rarr; <span content="00:30:00" property="aa:end">00:30:00</span> </h2>
<p>Baehr continues with a detailed description of the score, and how decisions concerning degrees and intensities were arrived at. </p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:32:10" data-section="18" data-start="00:30:00" id="data-start003000aastart003000_rarrdata-end003210_aaend003210_data-section18" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:30:00" property="aa:start">00:30:00</span> &rarr; <span content="00:32:10" property="aa:end">00:32:10</span> </h2>
<p>Baehr shortened the piece in a later version. She also put a faster part later in the piece, because the audience tended to react aggressively. “In normal dramaturgies, things don’t go slow again for a longer time after a fast part. If people don’t get the conventions they build up anger. I couldn’t deal with the anger thing, too much explaining.”</p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:34:53" data-section="19" data-start="00:32:10" id="data-start003210aastart003210_rarrdata-end003453_aaend003453_data-section19" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:32:10" property="aa:start">00:32:10</span> &rarr; <span content="00:34:53" property="aa:end">00:34:53</span> </h2>
<p>Usually Baehr starts the performance with a short introduction that mentions that there’s a score and that the performers have never rehearsed it. 
“More important than saying that it is based on a score, is saying that it is not rehearsed and that it is every night different. Neither me or the audience have control. I have formulated this very clearly [in the introduction text]: we are all of us witnessing what is going to happen here for the first time in this form. That way they are more like as witnesses of a car accident (...)”</p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:38:10" data-section="20" data-start="00:34:53" id="data-start003453aastart003453_rarrdata-end003810_aaend003810_data-section20" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:34:53" property="aa:start">00:34:53</span> &rarr; <span content="00:38:10" property="aa:end">00:38:10</span> </h2>
<p>Why were you so rigorous with the score? 
“The more you take the problem seriously, the more decisions you have to make. It’s like micros...The more you go into the details, the atoms, the possibilities on a [microlevel]. Also for William to do this. The concept was that we would do both pieces, but since it did not happen, it became my piece. But he had also a score, from which two minidiscs would have been produced. (...) So there’s the collaborative energy between two people, but also for the interpreters, as you were. You have this super precise information for things to do, and in a way it gives you a lot of.. What does it mean? Bend your arm. Everybody knows what it is ‘to bend your arm’, but nobody knows what ‘bend your arm is for 25 percent’. Then you get in trouble. If you are told ‘do the bird’, but then ‘go to degree 2 on scale from 0 to 10 with saccadic movements and bend your arm for 25 percent...’ Even if you have time to think about all the decisions you could make, you have tons of decisions to make and you see that the people [the performers] react differently. This was what I wanted to say about collaboration and freedom. When we talk about collaboration you have this thought in the background very often about the freedom of people involved.”</p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:41:14" data-section="21" data-start="00:38:10" id="data-start003810aastart003810_rarrdata-end004114_aaend004114_data-section21" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:38:10" property="aa:start">00:38:10</span> &rarr; <span content="00:41:14" property="aa:end">00:41:14</span> </h2>
<p>Baehr further explains with the score in hand how this was further translated into instructions for the minidisc. “This is how I transcribed the photo roman and these are Williams (he uses the sign system).” </p>

<p>Baehr uses on the minidisc scientific terms terms for the description of anatomical body parts. Baehr shows an anatomical drawing that they used. It’s using a woman as a model. Van Imschoot points out that this may be funny, since the piece was to be performed by drag kings, whereas the drawings are working with female anatomy. This leads to a discussion of the choice to work with ‘drag kings’ as interpreters. </p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:48:07" data-section="24" data-start="00:44:47" id="data-start004447aastart004447_rarrdata-end004807_aaend004807_data-section24" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:44:47" property="aa:start">00:44:47</span> &rarr; <span content="00:48:07" property="aa:end">00:48:07</span> </h2>
<p>For Baehr the choice for drag kings and queerness was imbedded in the piece. For one thing, it relates to the collaboration between Antonia and William. In contrast to the opera and high art material that was used in Holding Hands, the choice to work with pulp material (the photo novel) and counter its heterosexual normativity. Working with drag kings was also in response to a practice of </p>
<p>“The thing about working on dialogue and how to do that. This stuff is just like screamingly heteronormal. That’s really me: Choosing this was in contrast to Callas. We wanted to do something not from the big opera and high art. (...) This is the pop version and very cheap. There are all this heteronormal clichés. And also when we thought who should do it and it was such a formal piece, that it really smelled like you need to do it in normal everyday clothes. Since we always, William especially - we never have normal everyday clothes. In the video when we were the guinea pigs William with a pink little thingie there. And me with (laughs).. We were wearing our every day clothes, but it did not look like way, it did not look normal. It was the same concept as I did for Reproduction, to portray the male colleagues when they try to look normal on stage, like Xavier, Jérôme, Tino when he’s not naked on stage. There’s a type of trying to look normal on stage as white male in European dance (laughs) so we studied them.”</p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:50:19" data-section="25" data-start="00:48:07" id="data-start004807aastart004807_rarrdata-end005019_aaend005019_data-section25" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:48:07" property="aa:start">00:48:07</span> &rarr; <span content="00:50:19" property="aa:end">00:50:19</span> </h2>
<p>Eszter Salomon had seen <em>Un après-midi</em>. The way of dressing had interested her a lot in regard to her own project <em>Reproduction</em>. She was going to make a piece for eight men and eight women. Budget-wise it was interesting that all parts could be done by the women. Baehr became a gender consultant. She later realized it was more a matter of costumes than really working on gender. Part one comes the closes to <em>Un après-midi</em>. But the second part is different: in that part one can see that the men were actually women and the normal ‘male’ gaze of spectator is activated again.</p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:51:00" data-section="26" data-start="00:50:19" id="data-start005019aastart005019_rarrdata-end005100_aaend005100_data-section26" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:50:19" property="aa:start">00:50:19</span> &rarr; <span content="00:51:00" property="aa:end">00:51:00</span> </h2>
<p>A big difference between <em>Reproduction</em> and <em>Un après-midi</em> is that the latter works with desire. The desire of the interpreters to become a man and to be bossed around.</p>
<p>“Un après-midi is always based on the desire of the interpreters. Of both desires: to be told for half hour in your life what to do – which is really important, you need to have the desire to follow that strictly and not to punk around an not to make a revolution; to really have the desire, not just ‘I am fine with it’  – and to have the desire to dress up as a man...‘having lived as a woman for some time in your life’, which I had to add because in Leipzig...”</p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-end="00:53:23" data-section="27" data-start="00:51:00" id="data-start005100aastart005100_rarrdata-end005323_aaend005323_data-section27" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:51:00" property="aa:start">00:51:00</span> &rarr; <span content="00:53:23" property="aa:end">00:53:23</span> </h2>
<p>In Leipzig there was a conflict with two real dragkings (casted through a website for dragkings, Dragkingdom) who objected to a man being in the cast
“They made a point that it [dragking] is about power and the reappropration of power and all that. I kind of agreed. (...) They were saying that dragkinging - it’s a question of definition basically - is a reappropriation of the male power position, in order to do that you have to have experienced the other position. You can be transgendered but you have to have lived as a woman for some time in your life basically.”  (00:52:23 – 00:53:06)</p>
</div></section><section class="section2" data-section="28" data-start="00:53:23" id="data-start005323aastart005323_rarr_data-section28" typeof="aa:section"><div class="wrapper"><h2><span content="00:53:23" property="aa:start">00:53:23</span> &rarr; </h2>
<p>The nice part of <em>Un après-midi</em> is that it becomes political in the act of doing the piece, through dialogues with the interpreters, Baehr explains. Also the discussions on what it means to be bossed around, are very interesting to her. She relates this to sm. The interview further looks for analogies between SM-practice and collaboration models. 
Van Imschoot distinguishes the sexual contract between SM practitioners (as model to discuss functions and roles in collaboration) with the capitalist model of employee and employer. </p>
