The Active Archives Video Wiki inverts the paradigm of uploading resources into
a centralized server and instead allows resources to remain "active", in-place
and online. Caching and proxy functionality allow (light-weight) copies of
resources to be manipulated and preserved even as the original sources change
or become (temporarily) unavailable.

Strategically, the project aims to clarify some of the "cloudy" aspects of Web
2.0 regarding issues of licensing, sharing, ownership, access, and longevity of
online material. Designed to break open the "black box" of online video, users
are encouraged to write with video, creating new compositions made from
collages of disparate (online) elements.
