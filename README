= Migration Instructions =

South is an essential tool to keep your AA database up to date when changes are made to the underlying database structure (aka schema changes).
See "Schema changes" in the ChangeLog file for descriptions of when schema changes occur

1. Ensure that South is installed (one time only)...

* sudo easy_install South

2. Ensure that the aabrowser app is using South (one time only)...

* Add "south" to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
* ./manage.py syncdb

  to load the South table into the database.

  YOU MUST HAVE THE CODE IN THE PRE_CHANGE STATE at this point (if necessary svn revert first!)

* Run ./manage.py convert_to_south aabrowser
  South will automatically make and pretend to apply your first migration.

3. Use South to migrate the database (bringing it in line with the code)... (to be done each time schema changes)

* svn update
  to bring the code up to date, and include schema changes)
* ./manage.py schemamigration aabrowser --auto
* ./manage.py migrate aabrowser
